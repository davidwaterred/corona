Hi,

I have been following you since 1 week now. I do not agree with most of your things. I am a journalist at a local newspaper.

I believe that masks are very important for covid. I have seen a lot of evidence in a lot of reputed news websites. With great power, comes a great responsibility. My friend at NYTimes is doing a story on pseudo-intilictuals who think covis is a sham, and people who are against masks, vaccines etc. She will surely mention comma.ai as well. 

Also, I think you are an anti-nationalist. You come from a hacking background, so you dont care. I hope you know hacking is illegal and unethical. It is bc of people like you Apple had to spend $$$ to improve the security. They could have used it for better things. Like paying more to foxconn workers. Hackers do not reailze that what they do is not smart - goto YT and search "how to hack gmail" you will see 100s of vids. It seemed pretty easy to me. 

Who has given you a right to hack apple or sony, costing them billiions. Who has given you the right to say covid is a sham?? You also attack Christianity in your livestreams.  You offend a lot of people .if you dont want to be a man of faith dont be. But dont make fun of others. 

PS: companies like Google are proof why America is great, you have no right to diss them.



I am not coder and my cousin who is in IT support suggested me to contact you here.
